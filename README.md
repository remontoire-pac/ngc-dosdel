This repository contains MATLAB scripts and associated functions implementing and documenting cheminformatic and bioinformatic data analysis of a new DNA-encoded library of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) compounds. These analyses are described in Gerry et al. (""),  a manuscript submitted to ChemRxiv on YYYY-MM-DD (http://zzzzzzz). Code was developed using MATLAB 2018b (v9.5.0.944444), equipped with the following toolboxes: Bioinformatics, Curve Fitting, Database, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Mapping, Optimization, Parallel Computing, Signal-Processing, Statistics and Machine Learning, System Identification, and Wavelet. Computations were performed on a virtual machine (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2695 v4 @ 2x2.10 GHz processors, 32 RAM) running 64-bit Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.
